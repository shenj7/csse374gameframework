Violated design principles:
1) Don't duplicate code. There are multiple attributes/methods in both WordGuessingGame and NumberGuessingGame, such as scanner and showResult(), which could be lifted up into a parent class.  By keeping certain common fields in an abstract class, we can avoid duplicating code and provide a common structure to each game.

2) Add flexibility. Having each of these methods in a separate class makes it difficult to change the functionality - for example, changing the showResult() method to displaying in a JFrame instead of printing to the console. By creating an abstract class and using the template method, we can change functionality without having to modify every class.
